# Advanced Game Engine Scripting Issue Requirements
Before an issue can be moved from _backlog_ to _ready for development_
it needs to have the following **bare minimum** requirements. This will
help ensure that stories are scoped correctly before work begins so that
we can ensure that we continue to stay light.

## Issue Requirement Breakdown
Here's what we need to be able to say that an issue can be moved from the _backlog_ to _ready for development_

### Name
The issue name should be accurately and succinctly describe what's going on.
Issue must include student's initials as to associate the issue with their milestones.
Name must follow this standard: (StudentInitials)_NameOfFeature
eg. NJ_JumpMechanic

### Description
There needs to be a well rounded description that accurately describes
what the issue is and what's required for us to be able to actually get the
work done. If there's an ambiguity in it, it's not _ready for development_

### Requirements
This is what is **absolutely** necessary for us to be able to deliver in
a timely manner. No matter what the description says, **THIS** is what
allows us to determine if something is done or not. Each and every issue
should have well defined requirements that are spelled out. It need to
be:

> ...broken down Barney style.

There are a few _base requirements_ that we have and should be included
on any **code related** issue.

#### New Code
- Documentation on everything (commented)

### Previous Work
If there's any work that was done previously we should have that either
described or linked here.

### Other Notes
If there's anything that's relevant or people should keep in mind while
working on the issue it should be noted here. In our example you can see
that there are "extras" that are nice to haves, but they aren't defined
in the requirements, so we can't hold whoever is assigned to that issue
accountable for those things. However, a public flogging, generally
makes them think twice about ignoring those notes.
